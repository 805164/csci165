<h2>Hey, my name is Sabina :)</h2>
<br>
I am from Kazakhstan, Almaty. I speak English, Russian, Kazakh, and a little bit of Turkish. I am studying on my second year of college hoping to get a diploma in Business and a degree at UBC Sauder. My biggest dream is to end poverty and explore the world. I am taking the CSCI165 course to learn the basics of programming and know more about it because IT is our future!
<br>
<br>
This is my doggie Cooper and me!
